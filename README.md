Tool to easily get someone's ip, through instagram. Using NGL template and f3. F3 is an app that generates a link for your friends/people to ask questions anonymously and then you reply on Instagram story or other social network. And apart from that this ngl, which is the same. Just with another interface. At this time, the 2 most common are, F3 and NGL. Now it's coming back into fashion, so it's time to collect ips and find out who asked the question.
